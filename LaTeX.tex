\textbf{\TeX} (pronouned tech), created by Donald E. Knuth, is a program that is
designed to typeset text and mathematical formulae. \\\\
\textbf{\LaTeX} (pronounced luh-tech) is a kind of dialect of TeX, and is aimed to help beginners/authors to
format their work in a professional manner. \\\\
Together, the writer plays the role of an author, \LaTeX\ plays the role of a book designer, and TeX is the
typesetter. It is quite different from WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get)
word processors like \textbf{Microsoft Word}. You generally cannot see, in real
time, what your document will look like as you work on it in \LaTeX\ since you
have to compile it. \\\\
There are numerous ways to do so - programs like pdflatex and MiKTeX will
compile your \LaTeX\ file into a PDF, and there are packages/extensions in Emacs, Atom, etc.
that compile it from within the environment.

In addition, LaTeX is considered to be a programming language. \\
Various aspects of LaTeX are very programm-y. \\\\
For example, you probably already noticed
how \verb|\users| have a section at the top of their base file. \\\\
The \verb|"\usepackage"| command essentially functions as an import from an existing flo \
In addition, users can write thier own ``commands''.

%Basics
\newpage
\begin{center}
	\bf{\Huge{The Basics}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\LARGE
At its core, LaTeX is still a word processor, so if you just type text into a LaTeX file and compile it, something will appear. \\\\
\Large
But there are certain ways you always begin a new document. \\
\begin{verbatim}
	\documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{article}
	\begin{document}
	.....
	\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip
Any phrase starting with a backslash LaTeX will try to read as a command instead of plain text. \\\\
Here, the command \verb|\documentclass| allows you to set what kind of document you are creating. \textit{article} is for standard writing,
but there are also options for long reports, books, presentations, letters, etc. \\\\
The main arguments of any command are always enclosed in curly braces \verb|{}|, and the additional arguments are usually inside square brackets \verb|[]|. \\\\

%Environments
\newpage
\begin{center}
	\bf{\Huge{The Basics - Environments}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\LARGE
The \verb|\begin| and \verb|\end| statements you see indicate the start and end of an environment. \\\\
\Large
Environments in LaTeX somehow affect everything enclosed within the begin and end statements. The simplest example would be
the \textit{center} environment, which is pretty self-explanatory. \\
\begin{center}
	It does this to the enclosed text.
\end{center}
\begin{verbatim}
	\begin{center}
		It does this to the enclosed text.
	\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip
It's important to note that before and after an environment, a new line is automatically created. \\\\
White space works very differently in LaTeX. Pressing \textbf{Enter} to create a new line in the code doesn't create a new line after you compile. In order to go to the next line, you have to use a special command: either \verb|\newline|, \verb|\break|, or simply \verb|\\|.

%Intro/Summary 
\newpage
\begin{center}
	\bf{\Huge{The Cool Stuff}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\LARGE
Now that we've gone over the basics, let's take a look at some of the other cool things you can do with LaTeX!
\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphics
	\item Packages
	
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\Large
LaTeX has the capability to do almost anything that you'd need from a word processor. \\\\
In order to implement most of the cool features available in \\ LaTeX, we'll need to use packages. \\\\
To use a package, similar to imports in Java or Python, we simply declare \verb|\usepackage{packagename}| at the top of our file. \\\\
Afterwards, we can use all the functions that package provides. \\\\
There are a few essential packages that most people will end up using. \\\\
For example, the package \textit{fullpage} will set the margins of the paper to normal 1x1 instead of math paper margins.

%Graphicx 
\newpage
\begin{center}
  	\bf{\Huge{Pictures}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\Large
The easiest way to insert a picture in LaTeX is with the package \textit{graphicx}. \\
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{heavy_breathing}
\end{figure}
\large
\begin{verbatim}
	\usepackage{graphicx}
	.....
	\begin{figure}[h]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{heavy_breathing}
	\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip
Here, the \verb|[h]| is an additional argument that can be given to the environment. \\\\
h means to display the image \textit{here} on the page. Images enclosed in figure environments will float to the top of the page by default. \\\\
You can also use the arguments $t$ for top, $b$ for bottom, etc. \\\\
And you can use more than one argument in order of preference in case one of them fails: \verb|[htb]|

%SI Unitx 
\newpage
\begin{center}
	\bf{\Huge{SI Units}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\[x = 1.048\ \si{m} - 1.04\ \si{m} = 0.008\ \si{m}\]
\[F = mg = 0.560\ \si{kg}*9.81\ \si{m/s^2} = 5.49\ \si{N}\]
\[k_{eff} = avg(\frac{F}{x}) = \frac{1}{4}(\frac{5.49\ \si{N}}{0.008\ \si{m}} + \frac{7.94\ \si{N}}{0.017\ \si{m}} + \frac{10.40\ \si{N}}{0.024\ \si{m}} + \frac{8.63\ \si{N}}{0.020\ \si{m}}) = 504.5\ \si{N/m}\]
\bigskip
\begin{verbatim}
	\usepackage{siunitx}
	.....

	\begin{equation}

	x = 1.048\ \si{m} - 1.04\ \si{m} = 0.008\ \si{m} \\

	F = mg = 0.560\ \si{kg}*9.81\ \si{m/s^2} = 5.49\ \si{N} \\

	k_{eff} = avg(\frac{F}{x}) = 
	\frac{1}{4}(\frac{5.49\ \si{N}}{0.008\ \si{m}} +
	\frac{7.94\ \si{N}}{0.017\ \si{m}} +
	\frac{10.40\ \si{N}}{0.024\ \si{m}} +
	\frac{8.63\ \si{N}}{0.020\ \si{m}}) 
	= 504.5\ \si{N/m}

	\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
\bigskip
Putting a \textbackslash\ after any word or number adds a space. There are different size spaces you can add, such as
\verb|\,| (thin space), \verb|\enspace| (0.5 cm), \verb|\quad| (1 cm), etc.

%Code Snippets 
\newpage
\begin{center}
	\bf{\Huge{Code Snippets}}
\end{center}
\bigskip
\Large
Here's a code snippet which contains the code needed to insert a code snippet into LaTeX.
\begin{lstlisting}
	\usepackage{listings}
	\usepackage{xcolor}
	.....
	\lstset{
		language=[LaTeX]TeX,
		breaklines=true,
		basicstyle=\tt\scriptsize,
		keywordstyle=\color{blue},
		identifierstyle=\color{magenta}
	}
	.....
	\begin{lstlisting}
		.....
\end{lstlisting}
The \textit{listings} package provides us with the new lstlisting environment, and a way to edit it: \textit{lstset}. \\\\
\textit{xcolor} gives us access to the values "blue" and "magenta".
