\textbf{\TeX} (pronouned tech), created by Donald E. Knuth, is a program that is
designed to typeset text and mathematical formulae. \textbf{\LaTeX} (pronounced
luh-tech) is a kind of dialect of TeX, and is aimed to help beginners/authors to
format their work in a professional manner. Together, the writer plays the role 
of an author, \LaTeX plays the role of a book designer, and TeX is the 
typesetter. It is quite different from WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) 
word processors like \textbf{Microsoft Word}. You generally cannot see, in real 
time, what your document will look like as you work on it in \LaTeX since you 
have to compile it. There are numerous ways to do so - stuff like pdflatex will 
compile your \LaTeX file into a PDF, and there are packages/extensions in Emacs 
that compile it from within the environment.
